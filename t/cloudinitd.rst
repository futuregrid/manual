cloudinit.d
======================================================================

cloudinit.d is a tool designed for launching, controlling, and
monitoring complex environments in the cloud.
 Its most important feature is repeatable, one-click, deployment of sets
of VMs configured with launch plans.  These sets of VMs can be deployed
over multiple clouds (Eucalyptus, Nimbus, OpenStack, and Amazon EC2 are
currently supported), and can also include non-virtualized resources.
Like the Unix init.d process, cloudinit.d can manage dependencies
between deployed VMs. It also provides mechanisms for testing,
monitoring, and repairing a launch.
