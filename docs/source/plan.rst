Topic:
   FutureGrid Manual update

Lead:
   Barbara, Renato

Objectives:
    Currentlly the FG portal has some significant issues in regards to
    editability of the documents and the structure of the manaul that
    were introduced by not providing an integrated manual in book
    format. Furthermore we discovered that a significant number of
    documentations include for some unkonw reason (possibly related to
    some users not using the WYSIWYG) editor have formating issues
    that make it very difficult to correct the document. Thus we wil
    in this effort first create a "clean" document while using
    *reStructuredText* and at a later time introduce it back into the
    manual.

    It also allows the systems team to contribute better ass all of
    them are familiar with rst and are currently maintaining a larger
    number of FG related documents in github with it.

Deliverables:
    #. Agree on a timeline by July 1st
    #. Integrate the KB team editor in the editorial process **before** KB entries are derived
    #. Identify leads for each chapter, but make sure that **no**
        information is duplicated between chapters. For example we
        need just one chapter on ssh keys and not 5 as in the previous
        manual because the authors of the chapter did not consolidate
        between each other
    #. Make sure to work with the software teams tight delivery schedule
    #. be done with this by July 15th
