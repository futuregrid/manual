Development Projects
====================

FutureGrid provides a number of software development projects. Much
(but not all) of our work we have just begun to move to github.

 The documentation for these projects can be found
at \ `http://futuregrid.github.com/doc/ <http://futuregrid.github.com/doc/>`__
.


 As a part of FutureGrid, many other projects perform development as
well. These include Inca, Nimbus, Pegasus, PAPI, Vampir, as well as a
project called hostlists. These projects either maintain their own
repositories or use the FutureGrid sourceforge repository.
