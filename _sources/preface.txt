FutureGrid is a project led by Indiana University and funded by the
National Science Foundation (NSF) to develop a high-performance grid
test bed that will allow scientists to collaboratively develop and
test innovative approaches to parallel, grid and cloud computing.
FutureGrid will provide the infrastructure to researchers to allow
them to perform their own computational experiments using distributed
systems. The goal is to make it easier for scientists to conduct such
experiments in a transparent manner.

FutureGrid users will be able to deploy their own hardware and software
configurations on a public/private cloud, and run their experiments.
They will be able to save their configurations and execute their
experiments using the provided tools. The FutureGrid test bed is
composed of a high-speed network, connecting distributed clusters of high
performance computers. FutureGrid will employ virtualization technology
that will allow the test bed to support a wide range of operating
systems.

The NSF awarded $10.1 million to enable joint development of
FutureGrid through a partnership of Indiana University, Purdue
University, University of California - San Diego, University of
Chicago/Argonne National Labs, University of Florida, University of
Southern California, University of Texas, and the Center for Information
Services and High Performance Computing at Technische Universit√§t
Dresden. The principal investigator is Dr. Geoffrey C. Fox, Director of
the `Digital Science Center <http://pti.iu.edu/dsc>`__ at the
IU `Pervasive Technology Institute <http://pti.iu.edu/>`__.

$
    When showing examples of commands, the $ symbol precedes the
    actual command. So, the other lines are the output obtained after
    executing the command. An example invoking the ls command
    follows::

       $ ls

portalname:
    In some examples we refer to your portal name as |portalname|.

localname: 
    In some examples we refer to your local computers name as
    |localname|. Your portal name and your local name may be
    different.
